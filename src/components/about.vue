    <h1>I'm JB Fueston, and I like to make stuff.</h1>
    <p>
    I'm based in Edgewater, Maryland, and I specialize in mechanical and electrical engineering. I'm currently expanding into web design, as you can see by this website. Some of my memorable projects include leading the design and build of three unique ROVs and then driving them in competition at the US Naval Academy, making extremely powerful etching lasers portable, building my own computer, and many others in various fields. I love everything about engineering, and I plan to further grow my skills, eventually expanding into aerospace engineering. Thanks for checking out my page, and follow me on social media using the tag @jbfueston or clicking the respective logos below.
